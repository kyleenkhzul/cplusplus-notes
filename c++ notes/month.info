Description: 

This lab requires the coding and design of a class and accompanying library
to represent a single month of the year. The program is intended to take the
input of a the number of the month, the first three letters of the month, or
the full name of the month depending on user needs. The program can then
calculate the months in advance, the months before, and whether two months
in comparison are the same or not.
