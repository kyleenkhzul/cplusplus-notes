1. Does spacing between the numbers matter?
No, the spacing between the numbers does not matter. The program reads 
numbers from the file regardless of the spacing between them.

2. Do they have to be in order (ascending/descending)?
No, the numbers do not have to be in any particular order (ascending 
or descending). The program processes the numbers as they appear in the file.

3. Do they have to be integers? Floating point?
The program is designed to handle both integers and floating-point numbers. 
It reads numbers from the file and stores them as doubles, which can represent
 both integers and floating-point numbers.

4. Is it possible for your program to run out of space while reading the file?
No, it's not possible for the program to run out of space while reading the 
file. The program reads the file line by line and processes one number at a 
time. It doesn't store all the numbers in memory at once, so memory usage is 
minimal and won't cause issues even for large files.

5. When finding the largest/smallest item in a list, what value should you 
start with as your assumed smallest/largest value?
When finding the largest item in a list, you should start with the smallest 
possible value that the data type can represent, and when finding the 
smallest item, you should start with the largest possible value that the 
data type can represent. In the case of doubles, you can start with positive 
and negative infinity as the initial values for max and min, respectively, 
because any valid number will be greater than negative infinity and 
less than positive infinity.
