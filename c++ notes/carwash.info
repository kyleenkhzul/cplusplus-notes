Description: 

This program simulates a carwash experience for the consumer. The consumer
is prompted if they want a carwash and if so what kind of car wash. They get to
choose from three different types, Super, Premium, or Ultra. Each type of car
wash has a certain price which then the consumer is asked if the price is ok 
with them. If not, they are reprompted if they want a car wash again and the
program iterates through the questions until the consumer does not want a car
wash or gets a car wash and accepts the fee.
